How to all Delete old commits and make one commit which is the latest commit

This is the safest & cleanest way if you want to keep only your current code and wipe the rest of the history.

# Create a temporary orphan branch
git checkout --orphan temp_branch

# Add all files as a fresh commit
git add .
git commit -m "starting"

# Delete old main branch
git branch -D main

# Rename temp_branch to main
git branch -m main

# Force push to remote to overwrite history (WARNING: irreversible)
git push --force origin main
